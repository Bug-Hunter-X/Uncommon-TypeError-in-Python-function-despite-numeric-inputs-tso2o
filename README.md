# Uncommon TypeError in Python Function
This repository demonstrates an uncommon TypeError that can occur in Python, even when both inputs appear to be numbers.  The issue is caused by implicit type coercion.  The `bug.py` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.py` presents a corrected version.

## Problem Description
The function `function_with_uncommon_error` intends to handle both `TypeError` and `ZeroDivisionError`. However, under certain conditions (involving unexpected type coercion), it might still raise a `TypeError` even with what seems like numeric inputs.  The root cause lies in the implicit type conversion of the inputs before the division operation.

## Solution
The solution involves explicitly converting the inputs to a numeric type (such as float) before performing the division.  This eliminates the ambiguity in type interpretation and reliably prevents the unexpected `TypeError`.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `bug.py`. Observe the unexpected `TypeError` in some cases (depending on the input values, which may not always be obvious).
3. Run `bugSolution.py`. The corrected function handles the inputs more reliably and avoids the `TypeError`.
